Notes:

The parameters listed are the ClientSocket component parameters:

- The first parameter is the Address
- The second parameter is the Host
- The third parameter is the Port

This demonstration program works when in the first line of this file, the Address, Host, and Port parameters are set as follows, respectively:

- 10.10.10.2
- 10.10.10.2
- 4196

If the first line in a file is zero (0 - Address) , app will run, but won't do anything.
